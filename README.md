    Autonomous Reflective Generations (ARG)

back in 2021, tried to regenerate some of my drawings and paintings with open /source and for use/ libraries and tools out there. 

initially explored `noisfy` @ `generated.space` 


![some generations][project_arg_some_gens]


and those `machine interpretations` published at:

https://www.behance.net/gallery/128199015/

`something unique,` `something real.`

`rabbit-holed` 

< first animated version, beating like heart >

in this repo (in near future), will be including generated audio from an existing repo and include them as code, as well.

https://sonic-pi.net, so far has been the synthesizer incorporated with, on composing some tunes.

they are part of learning sessions and will be versioned here as well. they are written in `ruby` lang. 

I've found `sonic-pi`, quite solid. 

this folder includes code and recordings of some audio work here:

code: https://github.com/streamerd/musicode

recordings: 
https://www.ampled.com/artist/streamerd

with this tool, initially exploring some tools and filters, as well as to open a space for collaboration and prepare this repository.

from here and now on, future generations and regenerations, will be built in a branched fashion to be minted on blockchain, 

eg.  // as individual `ERC721`s and mostly, as `ERC1155` sets.

`EIP-2981` will also be tried for those to include a globally accessible royalty information, residing in NFTs' metadata files.

in the meantime, will contact to contributors of those public tools, and offer share in case earning happened. 

hence, some more supplies will be configured per image/token, to share some as gift to those tools' contributors.
